  Kundalini yoga is a form of yoga that involves chanting, singing, breathing exercises, and repetitive poses. Its purpose is to 
  activate your Kundalini energy, or shakti. This is a spiritual energy that's said to be located at the base of your spine Heightened states of energy are also heightened states of perception. The whole yogic system is aimed only towards enhancing your perception.
  A spiritual process essentially means just that – to enhance your perception because you know only what you perceive.
  This is the reason for the symbolism of Shiva and a snake. It indicates that his energies have reached the peak. His energies 
  have reached the top of his head and so his third eye has opened.''';
